WordPress Slider Revolution Responsive &lt;= 4.1.4 Arbitrary File Download Vulnerability Checker

# This script is designed to check websites for a specific vulnerability in the WordPress Slider Revolution Responsive plugin version 4.1.4 and earlier, which allows arbitrary file downloads. It uses the HTTParty gem to make HTTP requests and identify vulnerable instances of the plugin.

# Features:

ulnerability Check: The script scans a list of websites to check if they are vulnerable to the arbitrary file download vulnerability in the WordPress Slider Revolution Responsive plugin.
User-friendly Interface: The script provides a user-friendly interface in the command line, prompting the user to input the path to a list of websites for scanning.
Error Handling: The script handles errors gracefully, informing the user if the file path is incorrect and continuing to scan the remaining websites in the list.
Result Output: For each website in the list, the script performs the vulnerability check and displays the results. If the website is vulnerable, it outputs a positive message along with the URL. If the vulnerable file is detected, the script appends the URL to a 'config.txt' file.
Color-coded Output: The script uses colored text to provide visual cues for different outcomes. Green indicates a successful check and a vulnerable website, while red indicates an unsuccessful check or a non-vulnerable website.
Efficient Scanning: The script utilizes a loop to iterate through the list of websites, making HTTP requests and checking for vulnerability status.
